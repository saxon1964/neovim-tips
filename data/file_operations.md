#### Example

```vim
:w             " save current file
:w newfile.txt " save as new file
:wall          " save all files
```

# Category: File Operations
# Tags: ex, read, write, append, output
---
Use `:read` or `:r` to read file into buffer, `:write` range to write part of buffer, `:.,$w` for current to end.

#### Example

```vim
:r file.txt     " read file into current buffer
:read !date     " read output of command
:1,10w part.txt " write lines 1-10 to file
:.,$w end.txt   " write from current line to end
```

# Title: Ex commands - file permissions and attributes
# Category: File Operations
# Tags: ex, file, permission, readonly, modifiable
---
Use `:set readonly` to make read-only, `:set nomodifiable` to prevent changes, `:set fileformat` for line endings.

#### Example

```vim
:set readonly      " make buffer read-only
:set nomodifiable  " prevent any modifications
:set fileformat=unix  " set Unix line endings
:set fileformat=dos   " set DOS line endings
```

# Title: Save multiple files at once
# Category: File Operations
# Tags: file, save, multiple, wall, xa
---
Use `:wa` to save all modified files, `:xa` to save all and exit, `:wqa` to save all and quit.

#### Example

```vim
:wa      " write (save) all modified files

# Title: Path separator conversion
# Category: File Operations
# Tags: path, separator, backslash, forward, slash
---
Use `:s` commands to easily convert between backslash and forward slash in file paths.

#### Example

```vim
" Convert backslashes to forward slashes:
:%s/\\/\//g

" Convert forward slashes to backslashes:
:%s/\//\\/g

" Or use built-in function:
:echo substitute(@%, '\\', '/', 'g')
```
***
# Title: Update file only if changed
# Category: File Operations
# Tags: file, update, save, changed, conditional
---
Use `:update` to save file only if it has been modified, more efficient than `:write`.

#### Example

```vim
:update           " save only if file is modified
:map <F2> :update<CR>  " map F2 to conditional save
```

# Title: Handle different file formats
# Category: File Operations
# Tags: file, format, mac, dos, unix, encoding
---
Use `:e ++ff=mac` to reload file with Mac format, `++ff=dos` for DOS, `++ff=unix` for Unix.

#### Example

```vim
:e ++ff=mac       " reload with Mac line endings
:e ++ff=dos       " reload with DOS line endings
:e ++ff=unix      " reload with Unix line endings
:set ff=unix      " change current file format
```

# Title: File names with spaces
# Category: File Operations
# Tags: file, name, space, isfname, path
---
Use `:set isfname+=32` to allow opening file names containing spaces with `gf` command.

#### Example

```vim
:set isfname+=32    " add space (ASCII 32) to filename chars
" Now gf works on: /path/to/file with spaces.txt
:set isfname-=32    " remove space from filename chars
```

# Title: Check file existence in scripts
# Category: File Operations
# Tags: file, exist, check, script, function
---
Use `filereadable()` to check if file exists and is readable, `readfile()` to read all lines.

#### Example

```vim
" In Vim script:
if filereadable('config.vim')
  source config.vim
endif

" Read file into list:
let lines = readfile('data.txt')
```

# Title: Browse for files with dialog
# Category: File Operations
# Tags: browse, dialog, gui, file, open
---
Use `:browse {command}` to open file browser dialog for commands that take filenames (GUI only).

#### Example

```vim
:browse edit      " open file browser to edit file
:browse saveas    " open save-as dialog
:browse read      " browse to read file into buffer
:browse source    " browse to source a script file
```

# Title: Write file and create all directories form the full file path
# Category: File Operations
# Tags: file, save, write

Use this command to write file if the full path contains non-existent directories. All directories that do not exist will be created before the save:

#### Example

```vim
:write p++
```
