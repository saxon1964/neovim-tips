local lazypath = vim.fn.stdpath("data") .. "/lazy/lazy.nvim"
if not vim.uv.fs_stat(lazypath) then
  vim.fn.system({
    "git", "clone", "--filter=blob:none",
    "https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim.git",
    "--branch=stable", lazypath,
  })

    let env_var = split(line, '=')
    if len(env_var) >= 2
